# Organization Checklist

## Overall Meetup Organization

- [ ] The Code of Conduct for the meetup is written and attendees are aware of its existence before coming.

[small]#Attendees who had first or second-hand problems during meetups might avoid meetups with no CoC.#

- [ ] There are at least two organisers.

[small]#Being two allows you to split the load and be more accountable.#


## Meetup In a New Space

- [ ] If there is food served, make sure with the provider that you have options for those with dietary requirements

[small]#There can be philosophical, religious or health reasons for attendees to not eat meat. Their lunch should be correct nonetheless.#

- [ ] Check with the provider whether the new space is accessible without using stairs or narrow doors and give the information before-hand to attendees.

[small]#In doubt, reduced mobility attendees might avoid your meetup even though it is accessible. Or on the contrary, attend and be blocked.#

- [ ] Either there is no alcohol or attendees are aware of it in advance.

[small]#Some people are not comfortable attending events with free alcohol.#

## Session Content

- [ ] Talks are diverse and suitable for different experience levels.

[small]#The meetup should be accessible to all experience level and allow everybody to learn.#

- [ ] You have space for people to socialise and network before and after any talks you put on.

[small]#The meetup should be a way for everybody to learn and socialize.#

## Additional ideas

* If you don't get enough talk submissions, consider a social meetup with a just-for-fun quiz

* If your meetup is small enough, you can get everyone who is comfortable with it to give a short introduction to who they are and what they do

* Try to gently encourage people who have never spoken at tech events to give talks, and offer to help them out. Small meetups are a great way to lead up to conferences.
